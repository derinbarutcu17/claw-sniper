# Claw Job Sniper 🎯

**The autonomous recruiter that lives in your workspace.**

> "I hunt for jobs while you sleep." — *Kaira*

## What is this?
**Claw Job Sniper** is a universal autonomous headhunter for **OpenClaw**. 

It works for **any industry**—not just tech. Whether you are a designer, a marketer, a writer, or an engineer, this bot:
1.  **Learns your profile** by reading your CV.
2.  **Scouts your specific sources** (RSS feeds you configure).
3.  **Filters noise** using your custom keywords.
4.  **Drafts applications** tailored to the roles you want.

It automates the boring part of job hunting, so you can focus on the interviews.

## 🛠 How it works
Under the hood, it's a configurable engine running on the OpenClaw runtime (`bun`).
- **Universal Search:** You define the sources (RSS feeds from any job board).
- **Custom Filters:** You define the keywords that matter for *your* career.
- **Privacy:** It runs **locally** on your machine. Your CV and data never leave your computer.
