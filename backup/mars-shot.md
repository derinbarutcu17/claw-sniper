**Category:** Coding / Web Dev
**Year:** 2024
**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS

## Overview
Mars Shot is a high-performance arcade shooter built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. The game features fluid physics-based asteroid generation, a custom particle system for explosions, and a responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Key Challenges
- Implementing efficient collision detection for 50+ objects simultaneously.
- Optimizing frame rates for 60FPS performance on low-end devices.

## Why this proves my skills
It demonstrates a deep understanding of browser-native technologies, custom animation loops, and performance optimization without relying on heavy game engines.
